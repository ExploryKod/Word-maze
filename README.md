# A game to play with words

## Rules of the game
You need to guess 3 words that the program choose among a list of secret words. 
You have one point by good answer.
You win only if 3 words are found.

## Installation
You need to import it on your favorit IDE and play from your terminal.
You need to install PHP(https://www.php.net/downloads.php) and/or python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) locally.

## My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these two languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

## Versions
French version in python : a finished collective project with authors: Amaury Franssen, Farmata Sidibe, Abdoulaye Diop.

English version using PHP : this version remains unfinished for now. Author : Amaury Franssen.

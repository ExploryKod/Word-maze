## A game to play with words

### Rules of the game
You need to guess 3 words that the program choose among a list of secret words. 
You have one point by good answer.
You win only if 3 words are found.

### Installation
You need to import it on your favorit IDE and play from your terminal.
You need to install locally php or python:<br/>
PHP: https://www.php.net/downloads.php) <br/>
python : https://www.python.org/downloads/)

With python you can also use Colab through jupyter Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/.
Copy the code in a Colab notebook.

### My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these two languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

### The project has two versions:
#### 1. French version in python : a collective project.
##### Authors: 
- [Amaury Franssen](https://github.com/ExploryKod)
- [Farmata Sidibe](https://github.com/Farmata-sidibe) 
- Abdoulaye Diop.

#### 2. English version using PHP (this version remains unfinished for now.) 
##### Author : Amaury Franssen.

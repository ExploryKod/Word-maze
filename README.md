## <p align="center">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥A game to play with words ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p>

### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Rules of the game
You need to guess 3 words that the program choose among a list of secret words. 
You have one point by good answer.
You win only if 3 words are found.

### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Installation (only for development purpose):
ðŸ”¥See it on the web:
  - Through Docker
  - Through your own tools (only isolate through an env)

ðŸ”¥See it only in a command line interface through simple python file and a terminal (original version)

#### ðŸ‘‹Using Docker (branche: feature/config-docker)
- Install Docker 
- Configure docker properly (see docs)
- Go to the application root folder and type: <code>docker compose up -d --build</code>
- Go to your browser and access http://localhost:5000/

#### ðŸ‘‹Using the flask application (branche: feature/config-traditionnal)

##### install these necessary tools on your computer (or isolate them through a virtual env):
- node.js (and npm), 
- python3, 
- sqlite3

Install node.js by installing it through official website: https://nodejs.org/en/
Install python3 by installing it through official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Npm is already installed through Node.js, check if you have the last version and if not just do the second command: 
```
npm --version 
npm install npm -g
```
Everything is normally automatically added to your path. Check it if the first commande above don't give a version but through an error.

sqlite3 have to be manually added to your path (windows):
- Go the sqlite3 download page: https://sqlite.org/download.html
- Download a bundler where you have a CLI 
- Add a folder named sqlite3 to C: C:\sqlite3
- Copy sqlite3.exe file from the downloaded folder and past it in the new folder sqlite3
- Past the path C:\sqlite3
- open your system properties tool > go to environnement variables > choose path among system variables > click on edit
- add C:\sqlite3 to the system variables
- check in cmder if you succeed in adding sqlite3, type: <code>sqlite3 --version </code>
- You succeed if you have a version followed by oher stuffs. 
Sqlite3 is installed

Nota: To have a better access to sqlite tables: you can install dbbrowser as it is easier to see tables through this tool.

##### Install the app and its dependencies:
- git clone this repo
- Create a virtual environment Ã  la racine du projet.
- You can use venv already in default python: <code>python3 -m venv venv</code> ou sur windows: <code>python -m venv venv </code>
- and activate it (ex: in the root project folder type the path to the good activate file (windows) or type source + the good activate file (mac)). 
- Be careful: don't type active with its extension
- Install dependencies using requirement.txt : <code>pip install -r requirement.txt</code>
- Install dependancies from package.json using : <code>npm install</code>

##### Start the app:
- Using one terminal you start the flask interface : <code>python -m app.py</code> (be careful: you need to add extension or note depending your OS).
- Using another terminal you start tailwind css : <code>npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/dist/css/output.css --watch </code>
=> It will run in its watch mode 
- Check that you have an instance containing a game.db file in your directories.

#### ðŸ‘‹Using the original versions (python or php)
You need to import it on your favorit IDE and/or play from your terminal.
This game can only be played using command line interface.<br/>
You need to install locally php or python:<br/>
PHP: https://www.php.net/downloads.php <br/>
python : https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br/>

With python you can also use Colab through jupyter Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/.
Copy the code in a Colab notebook.

### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python and among my first PHP projects. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥The project has two versions:
#### 1. French version in python : a collective project.
##### Authors: 
- [Amaury Franssen](https://github.com/ExploryKod)
- [Farmata Sidibe](https://github.com/Farmata-sidibe) 
- Abdoulaye Diop.

#### 2. English version using PHP.
##### Author : Amaury Franssen.

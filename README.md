## A game to play with words

### Rules of the game
You need to guess 3 words that the program choose among a list of secret words. 
You have one point by good answer.
You win only if 3 words are found.

### Installation

#### Using the flask application
- git clone this repo
- You need node.js, npm, python3, sqlite3
- Create a virtual environment (ex: python3 -m venv venv).
- Install dependencies using requirement.txt : pip -r requirement.txt
- Install dependancies from package.json using : npm install
- Using one terminal you start the flask interface (python -m app.py)
- Using another terminal you start tailwind css : npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/dist/css/output.css --watch 
- Check that you have an instance containing a game.db file in your directories

#### Using the original versions (python or php)
You need to import it on your favorit IDE and/or play from your terminal.
This game can only be played using command line interface.<br/>
You need to install locally php or python:<br/>
PHP: https://www.php.net/downloads.php <br/>
python : https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br/>

With python you can also use Colab through jupyter Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/.
Copy the code in a Colab notebook.

### My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python and among my first PHP projects. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

### The project has two versions:
#### 1. French version in python : a collective project.
##### Authors: 
- [Amaury Franssen](https://github.com/ExploryKod)
- [Farmata Sidibe](https://github.com/Farmata-sidibe) 
- Abdoulaye Diop.

#### 2. English version using PHP.
##### Author : Amaury Franssen.

## A game to play with words

### Rules of the game
You need to guess 3 words that the program choose among a list of secret words. 
You have one point by good answer.
You win only if 3 words are found.

### Installation
You need to import it on your favorit IDE and play from your terminal.
You need to install locally php or python:<br/>
PHP: https://www.php.net/downloads.php) <br/>
python : https://www.python.org/downloads/)

With python you can also use Colab through jupyter Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/.
Copy the code in a Colab notebook.

### My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these two languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

### 2 versions

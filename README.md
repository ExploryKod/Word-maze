With python you can also use Colab through jupyter Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/.
Copy the code in a Colab notebook.

### My learning goals

I aim at coding with languages like python and PHP. 
This is my first project using python and among my first PHP projects. 

I want to compare both languages by coding the same game in these languages. 
As a consequence I'll have a better understanding of these languages by seeing differences.

### The project has two versions:
#### 1. French version in python : a collective project.
##### Authors: 
- [Amaury Franssen](https://github.com/ExploryKod)
- [Farmata Sidibe](https://github.com/Farmata-sidibe) 
- Abdoulaye Diop.

#### 2. English version using PHP.
##### Author : Amaury Franssen.
